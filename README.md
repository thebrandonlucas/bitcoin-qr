- [x] Poll for payment
- [x] Customizable styles

## Background

When developing a Bitcoin payment flow, there are multiple ways a user can expect to be able to pay. They might want to pay an on-chain address or Lightning invoice, they may be paying by scanning a QR Code from their phone, copy/pasting from a wallet, or via a [WebLN](https://www.webln.guide/) browser extension. Creating an intuitive interface that also captures all the possible ways a user can pay is one of the fundamental UX challenges of developing an application that can receive payments in Bitcoin.

This flexibility opens up many [exciting use cases](https://brandonlucas.net/articles/bitcoin/micropayments), but often comes at the cost of ensuring a smooth experience for the user. The greater the developer's cognitive load, the more difficult it is to create intuitive UX. And if we want Bitcoin to see more adoption, it's crucial to not frighten off would-be users because Bitcoin "doesn't work" or is "too complicated"..

This project aims to provide everything needed to allow standard Bitcoin & Lightning Network payments out of the box. It handles creating the proper [URIs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) from just an address or invoice, and favors creating unified URIs whenever possible. Styles are highly customizable and images can be embedded. It also includes polling functionality -- a callback can be passed as a property of the element to periodicaly check for payment.
